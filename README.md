## About Me
- Graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Game Design.
- Most of the time I spend on programming is done in C#, usually in Unity Game Engine.
- My friends and I have uploaded a free game to Steam, where you can play it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3324230/Critter_Gang/)! We uploaded it after we did the Ludum Dare Game Jam.
- I have recently been taking a Predictive Analytics course and have been loving the content.
- I enjoy playing games such as Terraria, Monster Hunter, and The Binding of Isaac.

## Current Projects
### Rumble City
- A 2D Platformer Party Game. I've been working on getting the core systems of the game implemented, such as getting the player into the game and transitions of stages at runtime. Currently working on Steam API Integration.

### Spellcaster Showdown
- A Third-Person Shooter where players pick their own spells to fight others in TF2-esque scenarios. Currently working on it for a class right now. Working on Aim Assist for controllers, but have already made the main spell system through polymorphism and prefabs provided by Unity.

### Pokemon Type Predictor
- A project I'm doing for my predictive analytics class. Can you determine the type of a pokemon based on it's stats alone? My prof and I have been talking if this is more of a classification or prediction problem, but regardless I'll be developing it.
