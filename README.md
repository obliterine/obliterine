## About Me
- Graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Game Design.
- Most of the time I spend on programming is done in C#, usually in Unity Game Engine.
- My friends and I have uploaded a free game to Steam, where you can play it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3324230/Critter_Gang/)! We uploaded it after we did the Ludum Dare Game Jam.
- I have recently been taking a Predictive Analytics course and have been loving the content.
- I enjoy playing games such as Terraria, Monster Hunter, and The Binding of Isaac.
